# Cautious Gamemaster's Pack 2

Offers various simple handy options.

This version is forked from [ShoyuVanilla's Cautious Gamemaster's Pack](https://github.com/ShoyuVanilla/FoundryVTT-CGMP) and contains a number of enhancements...

1. Added support for FoundryVTT v0.8.x
2. If the GM types a message while a hidden token is selected, this will be sent as a visible out-of-character message.
This assumes that the GM wants the message to appear, but forgot to deselect the token.
3. Updated to use [libWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper/).
4. Added compatibility with the "Tabbed Chatlog" module.
